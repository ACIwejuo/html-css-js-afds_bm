Our Story began around 2015, where we, a group of 4 sibling, would daydream about different story ideas in our bedroom with little more than notebooks where we'd written down story beats and created character designs there. Fast forward a few years later and we would find ourselves posting the initial prologue our first digitally made comic, Dimensions 2.0 on Webtoon. We were underwhelmed, to say the least, about our audience engagement and discovered that in order to gain attention to any future works, we'd need to be known.

That's why we created the AFDS brand, starting on Instagram, not just as way to showcase our art and inform people of future projects, but as a platform to showcase our growth not just as artists, but also story tellers, and individuals.
